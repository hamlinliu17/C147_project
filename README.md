# ECE C147 project repository (Winter 2021)

This folder contains the necessary code to run the GANs created by Hamlin Liu, Arjun Kallapur, Daniel Smith and Utsav Munendra. Below is a description of the directory and what each folder contains. We utilized Google Colab and its resources for this project
